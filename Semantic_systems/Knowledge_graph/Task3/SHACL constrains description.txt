SHACL constrains description

For all the defined property constraints, messages were added to provide clear instructions and feedback for data errors.

1) ComposerShape

Three properties shapes have been defined:
 a) Pattern constraint for lastName. This ensures the last name starts with a capital letter and the subsequent letters are small and not numbers nor expressions.
 b) Minimum length for firstName. It satisfies that there is no empty first name entry.
 c) Minimum/Maximum inclusive for age. With this constrain, the age is ensured to get realistic values between 0 and 110.


2) ConcertShape

The three defined properties are:
 a) Minimum length for title. It ensures titles take a meaningful string.
 b) maxCount for title. It ensures that the titles are unique per concerts.
 c) Maximum length for description. Sets a limit to description string and prevents from inserting a long description in the data.


3) EventShape

The three defined property shapes are:
  a) Max inclusive for eventDate. Ensures that events are not set beyond year 2050.
  b) Min/Max inclusive for eventTime. With this constraint, the events occur within a reasonable daily time frame (6 AM – 12 AM).
  c) Class and node constraint for eventOfConcert. Thus, each event is associated with exactly one concert.

4) MusicianShape

The used property shapes are:
 a) Min/Max count for id. Though this constrain, each musician gets exactly one unique ID.
 b) Pattern for lastName. It ensures that names contain only letters (no numbers or symbols).
 c) Min length for firstName. Sets a constraint, so first names can not be empty.

5) ProgramEntryShape

The following property shapes have been:
 a+b) MinCount for inConcert and ofTrack. It ensures that each program entry is linked to at least one concert and one track.
 c) Min inclusive for position. The position in the program must be at least 1.

 In addition:
  Logical constraint with sh:add. With that logical constraint, both inConcert and ofTrack constraints must be true simultaneously.
